# Databricks-AI-Challenge
This documents my progress and projects from the 14-Day Databricks AI Challenge organized by Codebasics and Indian Data Club. It serves as both a learning log and a portfolio of hands-on work with Databricks, PySpark, and big data concepts.

## Day 1 of the 14-Day Databricks Challenge

Today I took my first steps into the world of **Databricks** with **Codebasics** and the **Indian Data Club**, and it already feels like a whole new way of looking at data! 

---

## What I Did
- Signed up for **Databricks Community Edition**
- Explored **Workspace, Compute, and Data Explorer**
- Created my very first **notebook**
- Ran my first few **PySpark commands** 

---

## Key Takeaways
- Databricks makes working with **huge datasets** feel possible  
- Understanding the **workspace and compute setup** is just as important as writing code  
- Running PySpark for the first time was both **fun and rewarding**
